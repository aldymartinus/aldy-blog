When boredom suddenly kicking in and you need some new hobby 
to waste your time on, learning to solve rubiks cube (cubing) 
maybe a good hobby to pickup because itâ€™s actually a fun hobby with deep learning curve, 
so you can waste your time positively to get good at solving cube, 
btw you can get a pretty decent cube less than a dollar, personally, I will recommend Moyu RS3M a legendary budget 
magnetic cube with superior performance (unsposored btw).  

{/* At the end of 2022 i start solving this thing again
after so long (last played when am graduating from vocational), my only one cube actually 
pretty cheap and non magnetic it is YJ Guan Long with white base scheme (idk why white base so popular back then)
despite it cheap price, it performance actually pretty good, sacrificing it build quality, so light and hollow inside.
Back then, i don't really care about time whatsoever, as long as i solved the puzzle then it is, just like that,
back to last quarter of 2022, because of sudden boredom, i picking up this thing again and try to solve it, and guess what?
 
I forgot how to solve this thing, I only able to solve the first two layer, which can be done intuitively,
cause of that, I browse some tutorial to finish my puzzle and solved it 30 minute later (rusty muscle memory eh).

2023 it's here, and started to feel bored again, this thing is not helping anymore, then I grab my phone, browsing
online marketplace to purchase some new cube, and say what? they are cheap af, come with magnetic also.

Bruh, I write too much, it's not a short text anymore, and I feel too lazy to messing up with my blog layout,
I end it here for now, come back later if you like to read my BS (what a confidence eh, just like there are visitors). */}
