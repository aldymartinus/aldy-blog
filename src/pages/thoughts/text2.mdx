Been bingeing on some manga these weeks, Dandadan was so good that I finish it less than 3 days and now I craving for the next chapters, 20th century boys too, it give some stranger things vibes with different approach, and I think someday, when this got any chance to be animated, King gnu should be the one making itâ€™s soundtrack and songs.
